Feature: compose mail, save draft and send mail
  As a user of Pixelated
  I want to save drafts
  So I can review and send them later

  Scenario: user composes and email, save the draft, later sends the draft and checks the sent message
    When I compose a message with
      | subject          | body                                        |
      | Pixelated rocks! | You should definitely use it. Cheers, User. |
      And for the 'To' field I enter 'pixelated@friends.org'
      And I save the draft
    When I select the tag 'drafts'
    When I open the first mail in the mail list
     And I send it
    Then I see that mail under the 'sent' tag
    When I open that mail
    Then I see that the subject reads 'Pixelated rocks!'
      And I see that the body reads 'You should definitely use it. Cheers, User.'
